# Human Art Archive
Human Art Archive (HAA) is a collection of high-quality artworks, which are filtered with tags. 

## Mission
Today, if you want to find artwork online, you are bombarded with AI "art". Some of it is obvious, and some of it is hard to spot. HAA was created for the purpose of archiving and indexing artworks solely made by humans. When you browse HAA, you can feel safe that no art here was made with generative AI.

## Stance on AI
HAA strongly disavows the use of AI in creative spaces, including in the creation of visual artworks. Before this website's contents grows to a large size, steps will be taken to ensure the content on this website is not useful to the training of generative AI models.
