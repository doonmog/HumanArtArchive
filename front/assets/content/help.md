# Searching for art
You can filter the artwork on this database to find exactly what you're looking for in the following ways.
## 1. Using the advanced search page
Open the [Advanced Search](https://humanartarchive.com/advanced) page, and select the tags you're interested in. Try searching for a specific species, gender, and hair color!

## 2. Using the search bar
### Tags
In the search bar, you can type tags, such as - [female](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=female): This returns all artwork featuring female characters
- [neoclassical](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=neoclassical): This returns all artwork from the neoclassical period
- ["Napoleon Bonaparte"](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=%22Napoleon+Bonaparte%22): This returns all artwork depicting Napoleon Bonaparte

Note that tags which are multiple words long must be placed inside of quotation marks.

### Tag Groups
Some tags appear multiple times, as part of different tag groups. For example, [brown](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=brown) can both represent a person's hair, or a person's eye color. If you are only looking for characters with brown hair, and not with brown eye color, you can search for brown within the tag group "hair" like so: [hair-brown](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=hair-brown).

### Operators
You can use the operators AND, OR, NOT, and (). 
- [not male](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=not+male) returns all artworks without the male tag in it.
- [female or androgynous](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=female+or+androgynous) returns all artwork featuring female or androgynous characters.
- [blonde and (female or male)](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=blonde+and+(female+or+male)) returns all artworks featuring male or female characters, where at least one character is blonde.
- [male and female](https://humanartarchive.com/search?q=male+and+female) returns all artworks with male and female characters both present. 
The AND operators are implied, so `male female` will return the same contents as `male and female`.
