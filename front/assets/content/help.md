# Searching for art
You can filter the artwork on this database to find exactly what you're looking for in the following ways.
## 1. Using the advanced search page
Open the [Advanced Search](https://humanartarchive.com/advanced) page, and select the tags you're interested in.

## 2. Using the search bar
### Tags
In the search bar, you can type tags, such as - `female`: This returns all artwork featuring female characters
- `rennaisance`: This returns all artwork from the rennaisance period
- `"Napoleon Bonaparte"`: This returns all artwork depicting Napoleon Bonaparte

Note that tags which are multiple words long must be placed inside of quotation marks.

### Tag Groups
Some tags appear multiple times, as part of different tag groups. For example, `white` can both represent a person's hair, or a person's skin. If you are only looking for characters with white hair, and not with white skin, you can search for white within the tag group hair like so: `hair-white`.

### Operators
You can use the operators AND, OR, NOT, and (). 
- `not male` returns all artworks without the male tag in it.
- `female or androgynous` returns all artwork featuring female or androgynous characters.
- `blonde and (female or male)` returns all artworks featuring male or female characters, where at least one character is blonde.
- `male and female` returns all artworks with male and female characters both present. 
The AND operators are implied, so `male female` will return the same contents as `male or female`.
