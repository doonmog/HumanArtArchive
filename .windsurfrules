# About the project
This is a Docker/Nuxt/PostgreSQL/Rest API project for an online nartwork archive.

# Conversational Rules
Do not suggest any commands to start/stop the application. I will start the application myself and give you feedback.

# Code Generation Rules
Do not add comments that show what features have been changed. If you add a comment, it should describe a function or line of code, it should never show what change was made.

Try to keep files under 250 lines of code each. Put functions into other files and then import them into the mainfile.

## Front-End Code (under /front)
We are using the following nuxt packages:
- @nuxt/image (Always use ``nuxt-img`` instead of the native ``img`` element)
- @nuxt/tailwindcss (Default to using Tailwind CSS rules and icons from this package) (@nuxt/ui is NOT installed. Do not refer to it.)

All front-end API calls must use relative paths (e.g., /api/endpoint) instead of absolute URLs. This is to ensure they are correctly routed by the Nginx reverse proxy in the production environment.

## Back-End Code (under /back)
We are using Node.js and the back-end code is defined in the file ``/back/server.js``
Authentication rules can be found under ``back/auth/auth.js`` and ``front/middleware/admin-auth.js``

## Database (under /db)
We are using PostgreSQL and the database schema is defined in the file ``/db/init.sql``
